	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>The subject of this lab is to learn how to create structure within our file
		documents and add new files to the existing structure.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Overall, there weren't many issues when completing this lab. The only trouble we came across was inserting images into the index.html. We fixed this issue by realizing that the file names were mixed up. After this problem was resolved, the rest of the lab went smoothly.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>Here is a screenshot of the files we each created on our own local computers.</p>
