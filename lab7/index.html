      <h2>Big Idea</h2>
      <p> Customize our index.html using a css stylesheet</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>The subject of this lab is to make a basic CSS stylesheet to customize our webpages.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>We had many problems with this lab. We were not sure how to incorporate a class or style it properly, and the css file required a lot of trial and error.</p>
