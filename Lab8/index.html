          <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
          <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar using the css stylesheet. A big part of this lab was to use CSS selectors to stylize and personalize our website. Each of the ids and classes in our index.html will be customized with CSS selectors.</p>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>There were not any major challenges when completing this lab, aside from the trial and error when styling the webpage. I struggled a little bit with getting some of my classes, ids, and selectors to work.
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>This page is the results for our lab.</p>
