        <h2>Big Ideas</h2>
        <p>The subject of this lab is to get more familiar with using the css stylesheet. A major portion of this lab was to use selectors to stylize and personalize our websites. Each of the ids and classes in our index.html will be customized with selectors.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>There were some challenges with this lab because I struggled with getting the classes, ids, and selctors to work properly. There was also a lot of trial and error woth the page setup.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>These are the results.</p>
