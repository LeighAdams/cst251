		<h1>Lab 5: More html</h1>
		<p>This assignment requires us to add images and website links to our source code, and check to see if they work on the local browser and the server.</p>
	</div>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>There weren't many problems when completing this assignment.	The only thing that was kind of tricky was linking images to other webpages. However, it didn't take us long to successfully encode links in our webpages.</p>
