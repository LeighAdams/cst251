		<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated html</h1>
		<p>This assignment requires us to work with a partner, create a div id, and then upload to the server.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We had to work separately this time and then join together later due to a scheduling conflict. We did have to reference the lecture to remember how to do some of the tasks.</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>The results of this lab were that it was fairly simple onece we remembered how to do everything.</p>
